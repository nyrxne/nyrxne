👋 Hey There! Thanks for dropping by.👀 

Who am I? 
A goal driven and ambitious lad interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, who wants to build a career in it. 💅

🌱 Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in SQL and laying down a solid foundation in the fundamentals. 
🐯I’m excited to dive deeper into more advanced courses and push my limits.🐯

⚡ Fun fact: I am a trilingualist, always learning and adapting, both in language and in tech! 
Growth is my baseline, and standing still isn’t an option.
